**Task:** [RSS Virtual Keyboard](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/virtual-keyboard/virtual-keyboard-en.md)

**Deploy:** https://mracoon.github.io/virtual-keyboard/


The application simulates a virtual keyboard designed for the Windows system. This virtual keyboard allows users to switch between two language layouts, English and Russian (using `left Ctrl + left Alt`), and it supports inputting characters into the text field both from a physical keyboard and by clicking on the virtual keyboard keys with the mouse.
